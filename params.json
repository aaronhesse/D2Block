{"name":"D2block","body":"### This is D2block.\r\nDiablo II 1.13d introduced a new feature called the 'ignorelist'. This ignorelist file is a plain-text file which is loaded by the game every time it starts up. This file contains account names, user names, as well as patterns of text which are automatically ignored across the entire game, where and when possible.\r\n\r\nD2Block is a cross-platform (C++/Qt) application developed to assist in the automatic updating of this file. In this way, users are able to share ignorelist file contents with each other on a massive scale.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this sharing of ignorelists, all that has to be done is a web server needs to be setup with the copy of the ignorelist which contains all of the users/patterns to ignore. D2block will pull this ignorelist file down from the web server and merge it with the local copy of the file on the user's drive, while maintaining the contents of the file that the user may have already added. More information on how to set up a web server that other players can pull is available on the D2Block wiki at: https://github.com/aaronhesse/d2block/wiki.\r\n\r\nCurrently all of the Windows side of development should be complete. MacOS support should be coming next.","tagline":"Diablo II Ignorelist Auto-updating Application","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
